Bootstrap 3.0 Sticky Alerts using Angular JS service

Tired of using boring alerts, implemeneted angularJs service to mock stick alerts using bootstrap 3.0.

1. Same message wont be displayed once user click the same button while previous instance is active on screen.
2. CLose alert functionality is also implemented to remove alerts from screen.
